          <h3>Tajmahal</h3>
          <img src="tajmahal.png" alt="Tajmahal" width="400px" height="300px" />
          <p>
            The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of
            Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration
            came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the
            Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in
            Samarkand),[14] Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens
            and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's
            Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama
            Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily
            constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white
            marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his
            patronage reached new levels of refinement.[15]

           <p>
            The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj
            Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square
            plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an
            arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most
            Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.[16] The
            base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered
            corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is
            approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides.
            Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted
            archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either
            side. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered
            corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides
            of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of
            the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the
            false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves
            are at a lower level.
